# DOM Manipulation LAB

Many DOM manipulating exercises with a blog website. This single page site goes into how to manipulate the DOM using the browser object model, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Description

AIn this DOM manipulaion lab I go into creating elements, modifying them, deleting them from the array. I also use the browser object model to give user feedback as they are filling out a form. I added form validation and successfully updated the DOM dynamically. You are able to create a blog and delete a blog.
